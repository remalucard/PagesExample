<h1>Example Pages Site</h1>
This is an example of a Pages site I'm able to make in around 15 minutes.  
The theme can be changed easily by request if the right package is selected, but color scheme changes are provided for free by request.  
More content can easily be made and added using Markdown, an easy way to turn text into web pages.  
If you'd like a footer containing copyright information, a link at the top to social media pages, etc. that can be requested at no additional charge.
